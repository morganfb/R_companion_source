Strength was measured in both dominant and non-dominant arms before and after resistance training. The particular gene of interest here is ACTN3, the \"sports gene.\"\n}\n\\usage{data(famuss)}\n\\format{\n  A data frame with 595 observations on the following 9 variables.\n  \\describe{\n    \\item{\\code{ndrm.ch}}{A numeric vector representing the percent change in strength in a participant's non-dominant arm, from before training and after.}\n    \\item{\\code{drm.ch}}{A numeric vector of the percent change in strength in a participant's dominant arm.}\n    \\item{\\code{sex}}{A factor with levels \\code{Female} and \\code{Male}}\n    \\item{\\code{age}}{A numeric vector of participant's age in years.}\n    \\item{\\code{race}}{A factor with levels \\code{African Am} \\code{Asian} \\code{Caucasian} \\code{Hispanic} \\code{Other}, showing the participant's race.}\n    \\item{\\code{height}}{A numeric vector of the participant's height in inches.}\n    \\item{\\code{weight}}{A numeric vector of the participant's weight in pounds.}\n    \\item{\\code{actn3.r577x}}{A factor with levels \\code{CC} \\code{CT} \\code{TT}, that shows the genotype at residue rs540874 (location r577x) within the ACTN3 gene.}\n    \\item{\\code{bmi}}{A numeric vector of the participant's body mass index (bmi).}\n  }\n}\n\\details{\nThis data subsets the original data to match as closely as possible the Clarkson 2005 paper.
