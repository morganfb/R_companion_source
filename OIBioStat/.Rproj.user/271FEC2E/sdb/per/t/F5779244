The study sought to determine whether reproducing females allocated their energy to egg productions of size or number, which can both influence fitness.\n}\n\\format{\n  A data frame with 431 observations on the following 6 variables.\n  \\describe{\n    \\item{\\code{altitude}}{Altitude of study site in meters above sea level.}\n    \\item{\\code{latitude}}{Latitude of study site measured in degrees.}\n    \\item{\\code{clutch.size}}{Estimated number of eggs in clutch.}\n    \\item{\\code{body.size}}{Length of mother frog who laid the egg clutch in cm.}\n    \\item{\\code{clutch.volume}}{Volume of egg clutch in mm^3.}\n    \\item{\\code{egg.size}}{Average diameter of an individual egg to the 0.01mm.}\n  }\n}\n\\details{\n%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the __description__ above ~~\nFrom February to April 2013, the study team studied various populations of frog who live between 2035 to 3494 m above sea level in the eastern Tibetan Plateau.  They located breeding ponds at various altitudes, and at each one, obtained a small sample of freshly laid egg clutches.  They counted the number of eggs and weighed the clutch to determine egg weight, and approximated egg size from photographs.\n}\n\\source{\n%%  ~~ reference to a publication or URL from which the data were obtained ~~\nData accessible from Dryad Digital Repository: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6v0c1\n\nChen, W., et al.
